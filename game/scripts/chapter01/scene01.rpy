    The sound of water trickling down,{w} drowning out all the voices in the class.

    Each droplet of water creates a harmonious symphony, {w=0.3}calming, {w=0.3}
    more beautiful than any song I've ever heard.

    It was almost time to go home.
    
    It was the last class of the day.

    It was{cps=5}... {/cps}{nw}\nLoud.{w}

    {clear}

    Students were talking left and right, and I couldn't seem to focus on anything. 

    All I could hear was just water, pouring down.

    The rain was{cps=5}... {/cps}{w=0.5}{nw}\nLoud.{w}

    {clear}

    If someone were to talk to me, I wouldn't be able to hear whatever they would say.
    
    Not that anyone's gonna talk to me anyway.

    I'm not very noticeable in the class.{#noticeable? visible?}
    {#or replace with 'i like to think that im not the main character of my story. not trying to be visible, not trying to be popular'}
    {#just a side character in the background.}
    
    I don't really talk to anyone that much.

    {clear}

    I'm just another student in this classroom.
