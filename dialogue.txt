Rain.
The sound of water trickling down,{w} drowning out all the voices in the class.
Each droplet of water creates a harmonious symphony, {w=0.3}calming, {w=0.3} more beautiful than any song I've ever heard.
It was almost time to go home.
It was the last class of the day.
It was{cps=5}... {/cps}{nw}
Noisy.{w} {## Loud = big sound, Noisy = multiple sounds being played}
Students were talking left and right, and I couldn't seem to focus on anything.
All I could hear was just water, pouring down.
The rain was{cps=5}... {/cps}{w=0.5}{nw}
Loud.{w}
If someone were to talk to me, I wouldn't be able to hear whatever they would say.
Not that anyone's gonna talk to me anyway.
I'm not very noticeable in the class.{#noticeable? visible?} {#or replace with 'i like to think that im not the main character of my story. not trying to be visible, not trying to be popular'} {#just a side character in the background.} {## Certain without a shadow of doubt of not being noticable} {## If presume 'think that im not the main character of my story' he is not sure of his own thoughts} I don't really talk to anyone that much.
I'm just another student in this classroom.
My eyes felt {w=0.5}{nw}heavy.{w}
My eyelids kept falling down each time I try to pull them up.
My body felt imbalanced.
Going in an up and down motion, as if agreeing to something.
It feels like I'm about to fall at any point.
Falling down would {i}probably{/i} hurt.
I'd also attract a lot of attention.
I wouldn't want that.
I rested my chin on my arms.
It wasn't a very comfortable position, but it keeps me from falling down.
Fortunately, I'm seated far from the front, 
just behind someone with a bigger stature.
I'll be using you as a wall, {w=0.5}thanks.
There was a clock at the front of the class which had been conveniently placed above the blackboard.
It was placed there for the students to keep track of the time.
The teachers would often go past the lesson time and so the students would remind the teachers that it was time.
Although, some teacher would just get annoyed and it would end up being a longer lecture for us.
{## HELP. WTF. HOW.} {## nvl ga hilang} {## nvl hilang tp ak mesti hide show window}
{# teks nya makin lambat biar makin kerasa ngantuknya ea} {cps=*0.5}I followed the arrow head as it ticks around.
{cps=*0.4}Each ticks tells the seconds passing.
{cps=*0.3}Each tick felt {cps=*0.1}slower{cps=*10} than the ticks before.
{cps=*0.4}Each tick pulled me closer to the world of dreams.
{cps=*0.4}Everything started to squiggle around.
{cps=*0.5}If I were to describe it, {w}it would feel as if I am drunk.
Not that I would know what being drunk feels like.

As time{w=0.5}{nw} passes by.{w=1}{nw}
As the rain{w=0.5}{nw} pours down.{w=1}{nw}
As the voices{w=0.5}{nw} echoed out.{w=1}{nw}
It was dark, but it's different than that of a unlit closed room.
I could hear faint sounds in the background.
Sounds of the rain.
Sounds of my classmates talking.
Sound of my own breathing.
Moments had passed.
How long has it been?
Has the school ended?
Should I go home?
Will there be someone waiting for me at home?
Thoughts kept popping up with questions upon questions.
I felt calm—{w} no,{w} relieved.
The more thoughts that popped up,{w} the more relieved I got.
–up.
*shake*
-wake up
*shake*
–wake UP,{w=0.5}{nw}{done} OOI!
–wake UP,{fast} OOI!
A loud sound had pierced through my eardrums.
Like a gunshot,{w} piercing trough.
It had inevitably woken me up.
Agh!
Finally!
{cps=2}...{/cps}
What's with the face?
{cps=2}...{/cps}
What? {w=1.0}Gonna cry? {w=1.0}Want me to call mommy to comfort her dear little baby? {w=1.0}{cps=*0.2}Uhuu–{/cps}
{size=-14}Fuck off...{/size}
What was that?
There's no way I'm saying that!
Nothing.
Man, you're boring.
Hurry and sort your stuff out, {w=1.0 }I'll be at the gates.
...
He left.
I sat there trying to calm myself down.
It was quiet.
Looks like the rain had stopped.
I stood up as I watched my surroundings which were full of students now empty.
There was nothing but chairs neatly lined up.
The voices which had filled the room with laughter now gone, not a laugh to be heard.
All I could hear was just my breath and the sound of friction from my clothes.
I picked up my book which had been used as a pillow for my arms to rest on, store it in my bag, and left the classroom.
I walked along the hallway filled with puddles of water.
Watching my steps and carefully walking so to not slip.
The cold breeze scattered my hair around.
It's normally hot here, but when it rains, the air get really cold.
I met up with him at the gates and we head home–
Together.
The streets were empty, {w=0.2} a normal sight if you've lived here for a long time.
{cps=2}...{/cps}
{cps=2}...{/cps}
Not a single word came out of our mouths.
Reason was because We don't really get along much.
The only reason we were walking home together was because our homes are in the same direction.
Of course, we could just walk by ourselfs instead.
I don't remember when it started but we ended up walking home together since a while ago.
It became a routine for us, so we just went along with it.
Time passed, before I knew it, it was time to part ways.
See you–
{cps=2}...{/cps}
I raised my arm as to say goodbye, held it there for a while then lowered it down slowly.
Alone.
Again.
Arriving at my home, I took my keys and opened the door.
Clack*
The sound of the door lock opening, echoed.
No one was there– {w=0.5}as usual.
I entered my room, {w=0.5}put my bag down, {w=0.5}and lay on my bed.
I had been blinking every other seconds, with each blinks getting slower and slower.
Until finally–
My eyelids gave.
Ch*
A feint sond
Chk*
A very familiar sound.
Tchk*
One which I had heard many times over my life.
Tchk*
The sound of a clock ticking which accompanied my sleep.
Tchak*
